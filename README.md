# image_augumentation
The code applies a sequence of five different image augmentations to each image in the folder: horizontal flips, rotations, scaling, translation, and noise addition. The augmented images are saved in the same folder with a "aug_" prefix added to the original file name.

Here is an example:
```
python img_aug.py --path images
```

```
python yolo_aug.py --image images --label labels

```
